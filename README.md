# luan-bravo's .nvimrc

## External Requirements

## What I Use, for What and Why

## To-dos
- [ ] Actually write some stuff in this readme file
- [ ] Finally fix markdown note taking in nvim to ditch the [Obsidian App]()
    - [ ] Really badly figure transclusion for any file type with quoting from line slice or maybe even LSP assisted stuff?
        - [ ] Fix [render-md.lua](./lua/theprimeagen/unused/render-md.lua) first
